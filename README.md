# Tips 


Make sure to create your `utilities/credentials.ts` file
as specified in the [utilities/credentials.readme.md](utilities/credentials.readme.md) file.
Use the `user` `baseUrl` property for your page goto method.

When Running Tests, The Test Results Report and Videos (if enabled) will be in the playright-report folder, not the test-results folder. This confuses some people.

Video recording of tests can be turned on or off by going to `playwright.config.ts` and setting the video option to 'on' or 'off'.

When running tests, if you find it annoying to see the browser windows you can make the them non visible by going to `playwright.config.ts` and setting the headless option to headless: true

Make sure your MCP server is running by
hitting `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing "MCP" and clicking "MCP: List Servers".

When asking a chat agent to generate a test for you, include the file [.github/workflows/prompts/generate_test.prompt.md](.github/workflows/prompts/generate_test.prompt.md) as part of the context of your chat.
You can do this by clicking the **Attach** button and ensuring your chat is using Agent mode.

Logging in using the UI can be repetitive. Suggest you use a api call to log users in where possible.

6. **TypeScript** (Global Install):
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run the following command:
     ```powershell
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

> **Recommendation**: It is a good idea to reboot your computer after installing these prerequisites before continuing.
